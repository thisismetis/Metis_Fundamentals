# Anaconda and Metis Environment Instructions

Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python and package management platform that makes it easier to install and update the Python packages that are most commonly used in data-driven programming. Metis students taking a course with Python programming are expected to use Anaconda, and it **should be installed before the course begins, including the Metis environment**.  Installing the Metis environment is the easiest way to access all Python packages required in order to run course content code as well as complete project work.        

* If you are **installing Anaconda for the first time**, see the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/tree/master/anaconda_and_metis_env/anaconda_installation) 

* If you have already installed Anaconda, see [here](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/blob/master/anaconda_and_metis_env/metis_env_instructions.md) for instructions on how to install and work within the **Metis Anaconda environment**
