I used a linear regression model with one feature to describe Box Office Total Domestic Gross as a function of the Budget of the Movie.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget is not the only important factor in predicting the success of a film.
